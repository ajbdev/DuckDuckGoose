# Duck Duck Goose

Ultra simple Chrome extension that adds a "Google" button to DuckDuckGo.com search results page. 
Useful for individuals weening themselves off Google but aware of the fact that sometimes Google produces better results (for local/contexual searches, maps, etc)

This extension simply adds a Google link to the Duck Duck Go search results. It only runs when on the duckduckgo.com domain and requires minimal permissions.
